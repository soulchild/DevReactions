# DevReactions

Love the animated GIFs from [DevOpsReaction](http://devopsreaction.com) and [TheCodingLove](http://thecodinglove.com)? 

This little Perl app fetches those feeds and displays the GIFs in a random order in fullscreen without any clutter.

## Installation

```bash
perl Makefile.PL
make
plackup
```

Fire up your browser and go to: http://localhost:5000. Enjoy!
